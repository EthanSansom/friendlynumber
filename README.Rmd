{friendlynumber} translates vectors of numbers into character vectors of 
English numerals (AKA number words). Supported numerals include:

* Cardinals: one, ten and two thirds, one thousand twenty-one
* Ordinals: first, second, one millionth, 1st, 2nd, 1,000,000th
* Counts: no times, once, twice, three times
* Quantifiers: no, the, both, all three, all 999, every

{friendlynumber} functions are intended to be used internally by other packages
(e.g. for generating friendly error messages). To this end, {friendlynumber} is
written in base R and has no Imports.

## Installation

Install the released version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("friendlynumber")
```

You can install the development version of {friendlynumber} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("EthanSansom/friendlynumber")
```

## Features

```{r load-pkg}
library(friendlynumber)
```

### Cardinal Numerals

`number_friendly()` is an S3 generic which converts numbers in `R` into cardinal numerals.

```{r number-friendly}
number_friendly(c(0:3, 2/3, 1/100, NA, NaN, Inf))
```

`number_friendly()` defines methods for four number classes included in base `R` 
and the [{bignum}](https://davidchall.github.io/bignum/) package:

* Base `<integer>` and `<numeric>` vectors
* {bignum} `<bignum_biginteger>` vectors, which can store arbitrarily large integers
* {bignum} `<bignum_bigfloat>` vectors, which store numbers with 50 decimal digits of precision

Each method has a corresponding standalone `*_friendly()` function which expects 
a number of a specific class.

```{r number-friendly-methods}
number_friendly(1L)                     # integerish_friendly()
number_friendly(1.0)                    # numeric_friendly()
number_friendly(bignum::biginteger(1L)) # biginteger_friendly()
number_friendly(bignum::bigfloat(1.0))  # bigfloat_friendly()
```

### Other Numerals

{friendlynumber} provides an additional set of functions for translating whole
numbers (e.g. `1L` or `1.00`) into common numeral types.

```{r whole-friendly}
# Ordinals
ordinal_friendly(0:4)

# Numeric Ordinals
nth_friendly(0:4)

# Counts
ntimes_friendly(0:4)

# Quantifiers
quantifier_friendly(0:4)
```

### Precision

{friendlynumber} provides two `options()` for setting the number of decimals
that {friendlynumber} functions report.

```{r preserve-opts, include = FALSE}
opts <- options()
```

```{r opts}
options(
  friendlynumber.numeric.digits = 3, # Effects `<numeric>` numbers
  friendlynumber.bigfloat.digits = 5 # Effects `<bignum_bigfloat>` numbers
)

numeric_friendly(0.12345)
bigfloat_friendly(bignum::bigfloat(0.12345))
```

`format_number()` is a utility function which formats numbers via `format()` and
abides by these options.

```{r format-number}
format_number(0.12345)
format_number(bignum::bigfloat(0.12345))
```

This is useful for verifying whether unexpected results are a consequence of
precision issues. For instance, look what happens when we attempt to translate
the number "ten billion and one hundred-thousandth".

```{r precision-issue}
options(
  friendlynumber.numeric.digits = 7, 
  friendlynumber.bigfloat.digits = 7
)

numeric_friendly(10000000000.00001)
bigfloat_friendly(bignum::bigfloat("10000000000.00001"))
```

```{r reset-opts, include = FALSE}
options(opts)
```

We can use `format_number()` to confirm that, on my machine, a `<numeric>` 
vector lacks the precision to store this number accurately.

```{r precision-check}
format_number(10000000000.00001)
format_number(bignum::bigfloat("10000000000.00001"))
```

Similar problems can arise when working with whole numbers. Consider the number
"ten quadrillion" minus one.

```{r whole-precision-numeric}
numeric_friendly(10000000000000000 - 1)
```

```{r whole-precision-bigfloat}
biginteger_friendly(bignum::biginteger("10000000000000000") - 1L)
```

## Advantages

{friendlynumber} is faster than other alternatives written in base R - such as
the [{english}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=english) and 
[{nombre}](https://nombre.rossellhayes.com/) packages.

```{r benchmarks-scalar-small}
# Scalar (small)
bench::mark(
  english = as.character(english::english(1L)),
  nombre = as.character(nombre::nom_card(1L)),
  friendlynumber = as.character(number_friendly(1L))
)[1:6]
```

```{r benchmarks-scalar-large}
# Scalar (large)
bench::mark(
  english = as.character(english::english(100000)),
  nombre = as.character(nombre::nom_card(100000)),
  friendlynumber = as.character(number_friendly(100000))
)[1:6]
```

```{r benchmarks-vector}
# Vector
bench::mark(
  english = as.character(english::english(1:10000)),
  nombre = as.character(nombre::nom_card(1:10000)),
  friendlynumber = as.character(number_friendly(1:10000)),
  filter_gc = FALSE
)[1:6]
```

To increase the speed of processing scalar inputs, the set of `*_friendly()` 
functions do not check that their arguments are of valid types. All
`*_friendly()` functions have a slightly slower `*_friendly_safe()` 
alternative which confirms that it's arguments are of the correct type and 
emits an informative error otherwise.

```{r safe}
try(integerish_friendly_safe(numbers = 1/2))
```

When used with the {bignum} package, {friendlynumber} is capable of translating
extremely large numbers into cardinal numerals. Here, we translate a number equal
to 1 followed by three thousand and three 0's.

```{r millinillion}
number_friendly(bignum::biginteger(10L)^3003L)
```

## Inspiration

This package was originally inspired by the [{english}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=english)
package by John Fox, Bill Venables, Anthony Damico and Anne Pier Salverda, which 
inspired my fixation with the problem of converting numbers to numerals.

Several functions in {friendlynumber} were inspired by Alexander Rossell Hayes'
[{nombre}](https://nombre.rossellhayes.com/) package:

* `ntimes_friendly()` is based on [nombre::adverbial()](https://nombre.rossellhayes.com/reference/adverbial.html)
* `quantifier_friendly()` is based on [nombre::collective()](https://nombre.rossellhayes.com/reference/collective.html)

The following sources were very helpful for naming extremely large numbers:

* The blog [Pointless Large Number Stuff](https://sites.google.com/site/pointlesslargenumberstuff/home/1/extendedillions1) by @cookiefonster informed the naming of numbers larger than 1,000,000
* Robert Munafo's writing on the [Conway-Wechsler system](https://www.mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html#conway-wechsler) for
naming arbitrarily large numbers was used for the naming of numbers 10^3003 and larger
* Steve Olsen's table of ["Big-Ass Numbers"](https://www.olsenhome.com/bignumbers/) was used for testing `number_friendly()`
